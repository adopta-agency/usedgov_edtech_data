<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This project makes the data associated with education technology available in an open and editable format. By using the "Adopta.Agency" framework - that is, adopting Department of Education datasets - federal ed-tech datasets will be cleaned up, standardized, and made machine- and human-readable.</p>

<p>This site uses the <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency</a> open data blueprint. That is, it is an <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">open Github template designed to be forked</a> and used to improve government and other public datasets.</p>

<p>You can find more information about this project on the <a href="http://adopta.agency/">Adopta.Agency website</a>.</p>
